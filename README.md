## **Overview**

<br />

Cascade UI is a lightweight, robust component library made with clean components. With the help of this, developers can build their projects much faster using pre-defined classes while focussing on functionality rather than designing.

<br />

### **Installation Guide**

Copy and paste the below code in the `head` tag of your html document and start using the Cascade UI by just adding class names to your html elements.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cascadeui-robust.netlify.app/css/components.css"
/>
```

<br/>

## **My Journey**

<br />

### **What I learned**

Making this Component Library helped me to brush up my CSS skills. Now, I am familiar with the designing styles. Really learnt a lot.

**My Takeaways:**

1. Donâ€™t take CSS as hit-&-trial, rather take it up logically. Understand why something is not working and other thing is. ðŸŽ¯
2. Value calculations in CSS.
3. Stacking context and z-index.
4. Responsive images.
5. Flexbox.
6. Grid.

<br />

### **Tech Stack**

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox Layout
- Grid Layout

<br />

## **Running this app Locally**

1. Clone the repository by running this command in your terminal.

```
gh repo clone shanolhere/Cascade-UI
```

2. A directory named "Cascade-UI" will be created on your machine.
3. Go to the index.html and use the live server to run the project.

## **Contributing to the project**

1. Do the steps (1-2) exactly as above.
2. Refer the **style-guide.css** and **reset.css** to get the idea what pattern is followed.
3. Create a new branch from **dev** branch.
4. Make the changes.
5. Commit the Changes.
6. Push the changes and open a pull request.
7. Pull request will be reviewed by the maintainer and merged if found okay.

_Note: Please describe the component/changes you have made in your pull request. It would be nice if you could attach a visual example for the same._
